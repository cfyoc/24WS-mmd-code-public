MMD Exercise 10/30/24

- no solutions for exercise sheets, unsure if it will be released at any point
- fine if you just submit python files or jupyter notebook and if their were tests to run and if you didnt do it in a notebook we can just write results down in a file and submit that file
- comments in code also nice
- more guidance may be given in future exercise sheets

ex1
complete code implementations:
use np.dot transpose util matrix with .T
np.argsort(similarities[users_who_rated])
np.dot(sim[beset_among], orig_util[item_index, best_among]) / np.sum(np.abs(sim[best_among]))
